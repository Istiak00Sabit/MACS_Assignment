## Algorithm: XOR-Rotate Cipher

### Overview
A symmetric cipher combining bitwise XOR with character rotation for encryption/decryption.

### Algorithm Steps

#### Encryption:
1. XOR each character with secret key
2. Rotate string right by 1 position

#### Decryption:
1. Rotate string left by 1 position
2. XOR each character with same key
